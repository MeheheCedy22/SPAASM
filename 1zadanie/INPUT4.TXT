The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell 
it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. 
It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; 
immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great 
miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to
 the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was 
bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them 
deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of 
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged, in secret, a master ring to control 
all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will 
to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one, the Free Lands of 
Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. 
A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on 
the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory 
was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment,
when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's 
sword. And Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The
Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but 
the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its
own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should not have 
been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for 
two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, 
when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The ring came to the creature 
Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it 
consumed him. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years, it
poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept
back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East - 
whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now 
come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A hobbit, Bilbo 
Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the 
fortunes of all... 
numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and 
understand patterns in the world around us. without numbers, many aspects of 
modern life, such as technology, finance, and engineering, would not function 
properly. there are several types of numbers, each with its own properties and 
applications. natural numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, are used for 
counting. whole numbers include 0 in addition to natural numbers. integers 
extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational 
numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3/4, while irrational 
numbers, such as pi (3.14159...) and sqrt(2) (1.414...), cannot be written as 
exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.
sports scores, such as 3-1 in soccer or 102-98 in basketball, determine 
winners. movies and tv shows are rated with numbers, like 8.5/10 on review 
sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining 
rhythm, such as 120 bpm for a standard pop song. numbers are truly everywhere, 
helping us organize, predict, and understand the world. without them, life as 
we know it would be chaotic and unstructured.

exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.
sports scores, such as 3-1 in soccer or 102-98 in basketball, determine 
winners. movies and tv shows are rated with numbers, like 8.5/10 on review 
sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining 
rhythm, such as 120 bpm for a standard pop song. numbers are truly everywhere, 
helping us organize, predict, and understand the world. without them, life as 
we know it would be chaotic and unstructured. 
numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and 
understand patterns in the world around us. without numbers, many aspects of 
modern life, such as technology, finance, and engineering, would not function 
properly. there are several types of numbers, each with its own properties and 
applications. natural numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, are used for 
counting. whole numbers include 0 in addition to natural numbers. integers 
extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational

numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and

modern life, such as technology, finance, and engineering, would not function 
properly. there are several types of numbers, each with its own properties and 
applications. natural numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, are used for 
counting. whole numbers include 0 in addition to natural numbers. integers 
extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational 
numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3/4, while irrational 
numbers, such as pi (3.14159...) and sqrt(2) (1.414...), cannot be written as 
exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.

The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell 
it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. 
It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; 
immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great 
miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to
 the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was 
bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them 
deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of 
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged, in secret, a master ring to control 
all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will 
to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one, the Free Lands of 
Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. 
A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on 
the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory 
was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment,
when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's 
sword. And Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The
Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but 
the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its
own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should not have 
been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for 
two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, 
when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The ring came to the creature 
Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it 
consumed him. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years, it
poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept
back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East - 
whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now 
come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A hobbit, Bilbo 
Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the 
fortunes of all...

checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.
sports scores, such as 3-1 in soccer or 102-98 in basketball, determine 
winners. movies and tv shows are rated with numbers, like 8.5/10 on review 
sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining 
rhythm, such as 120 bpm for a standard pop song. numbers are truly everywhere, 
helping us organize, predict, and understand the world. without them, life as 
we know it would be chaotic and unstructured. 
numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and

helping us organize, predict, and understand the world. without them, life as 
we know it would be chaotic and unstructured. 
numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and 
understand patterns in the world around us. without numbers, many aspects of 
modern life, such as technology, finance, and engineering, would not function 
properly. there are several types of numbers, each with its own properties and 
applications. natural numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, are used for 
counting. whole numbers include 0 in addition to natural numbers. integers 
extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational 
numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3/4, while irrational 
numbers, such as pi (3.14159...) and sqrt(2) (1.414...), cannot be written as 
exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.
sports scores, such as 3-1 in soccer or 102-98 in basketball, determine 
winners. movies and tv shows are rated with numbers, like 8.5/10 on review 
sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining

The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell 
it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. 
It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; 
immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great 
miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to
 the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was 
bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them 
deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of 
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged, in secret, a master ring to control 
all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will 
to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one, the Free Lands of 
Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. 
A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on 
the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory 
was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment,
when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's 
sword. And Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The
Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but 
the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its
own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should not have 
been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for 
two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, 
when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The ring came to the creature 
Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it 
consumed him. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years, it
poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept
back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East - 
whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now 
come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A hobbit, Bilbo 
Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the 
fortunes of all...

extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational 
numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3/4, while irrational 
numbers, such as pi (3.14159...) and sqrt(2) (1.414...), cannot be written as 
exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.
sports scores, such as 3-1 in soccer or 102-98 in basketball, determine 
winners. movies and tv shows are rated with numbers, like 8.5/10 on review 
sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining 
rhythm, such as 120 bpm for a standard pop song. numbers are truly everywhere, 
helping us organize, predict, and understand the world. without them, life as 
we know it would be chaotic and unstructured. 
numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and

sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining 
rhythm, such as 120 bpm for a standard pop song. numbers are truly everywhere, 
helping us organize, predict, and understand the world. without them, life as 
we know it would be chaotic and unstructured. 
numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and 
understand patterns in the world around us. without numbers, many aspects of 
modern life, such as technology, finance, and engineering, would not function 
properly. there are several types of numbers, each with its own properties and 
applications. natural numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, are used for 
counting. whole numbers include 0 in addition to natural numbers. integers 
extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational 
numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3/4, while irrational 
numbers, such as pi (3.14159...) and sqrt(2) (1.414...), cannot be written as 
exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.

The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell 
it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. 
It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; 
immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great 
miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to
 the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was 
bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them 
deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of 
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged, in secret, a master ring to control 
all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will 
to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one, the Free Lands of 
Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. 
A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on 
the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory 
was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment,
when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's 
sword. And Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The
Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but 
the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its
own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should not have 
been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for 
two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, 
when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The ring came to the creature 
Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it 
consumed him. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years, it
poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept
back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East - 
whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now 
come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A hobbit, Bilbo 
Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the 
fortunes of all...

applications. natural numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, are used for 
counting. whole numbers include 0 in addition to natural numbers. integers 
extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational 
numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3/4, while irrational 
numbers, such as pi (3.14159...) and sqrt(2) (1.414...), cannot be written as 
exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in 
astronomy, distances are measured in light-years, such as 4.24 light-years to 
the closest star, proxima centauri. even in entertainment, numbers play a role.
sports scores, such as 3-1 in soccer or 102-98 in basketball, determine 
winners. movies and tv shows are rated with numbers, like 8.5/10 on review 
sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining 
rhythm, such as 120 bpm for a standard pop song. numbers are truly everywhere, 
helping us organize, predict, and understand the world. without them, life as 
we know it would be chaotic and unstructured.

sports scores, such as 3-1 in soccer or 102-98 in basketball, determine 
winners. movies and tv shows are rated with numbers, like 8.5/10 on review 
sites. music follows numerical patterns, with beats per minute (bpm) defining

numbers are an essential part of life, shaping everything from basic counting 
to advanced scientific discoveries. they help us measure, calculate, and

modern life, such as technology, finance, and engineering, would not function 
properly. there are several types of numbers, each with its own properties and 
applications. natural numbers, such as 1, 2, 3, and so on, are used for 
counting. whole numbers include 0 in addition to natural numbers. integers 
extend this by including negative numbers, such as -1, -2, and -3. rational 
numbers can be expressed as fractions, like 1/2 or 3/4, while irrational 
numbers, such as pi (3.14159...) and sqrt(2) (1.414...), cannot be written as 
exact fractions. in everyday life, we use numbers in countless ways. when 
checking the time, we rely on a 24-hour or 12-hour clock system. temperatures 
are measured in degrees, like 37 degrees celsius for body temperature or -10 
degrees celsius on a cold winter day. money transactions involve numbers, from 
calculating discounts to managing bank accounts. for instance, if an item costs
dollar 50 and has a 20% discount, we subtract dollar 10, making the final price
dollar 40. science and technology heavily depend on numbers. in physics, 
formulas like f = ma (force = mass × acceleration) describe motion. in computer
science, binary numbers (0 and 1) form the basis of digital systems. in

The world is changed. I feel it in the water. I feel it in the earth. I smell 
it in the air. Much that once was is lost, for none now live who remember it. 
It began with the forging of the Great Rings. Three were given to the Elves; 
immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings. Seven to the Dwarf Lords, great 
miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls. And nine, nine rings were gifted to
 the race of Men, who above all else desire power. For within these rings was 
bound the strength and will to govern each race. But they were all of them 
deceived, for another ring was made. In the land of Mordor, in the fires of 
Mount Doom, the Dark Lord Sauron forged, in secret, a master ring to control 
all others. And into this ring he poured his cruelty, his malice and his will 
to dominate all life. One ring to rule them all. One by one, the Free Lands of 
Middle-Earth fell to the power of the Ring. But there were some who resisted. 
A last alliance of men and elves marched against the armies of Mordor. And on 
the slopes of Mount Doom, they fought for the freedom of Middle-Earth. Victory 
was near, but the power of the ring could not be undone. It was in this moment,
when all hope had faded, that Isildur, son of the king, took up his father's 
sword. And Sauron, enemy of the free peoples of Middle-Earth, was defeated. The
Ring passed to Isildur, who had this one chance to destroy evil forever, but 
the hearts of men are easily corrupted. And the ring of power has a will of its
own. It betrayed Isildur, to his death. And some things that should not have 
been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for 
two and a half thousand years, the ring passed out of all knowledge. Until, 
when chance came, it ensnared a new bearer. The ring came to the creature 
Gollum, who took it deep into the tunnels of the Misty Mountains. And there it 
consumed him. The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life. For 500 years, it
poisoned his mind. And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited. Darkness crept
back into the forests of the world. Rumor grew of a shadow in the East - 
whispers of a nameless fear. And the Ring of Power perceived its time had now 
come. It abandoned Gollum. But something happened then the Ring did not intend.
It was picked up by the most unlikely creature imaginable. A hobbit, Bilbo 
Baggins of the Shire. For the time will soon come when hobbits will shape the 
fortunes of all...
